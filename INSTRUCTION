## Term Group Project 

Given the following example programs:

* `fashion_mnist_dnn.py`
   this program creates a DNN model for predicting clothing type based on Fashion MNIST dataset.

* `cloth_classifier.py`
   this.program is a GUI program for Photo viewing, editing, and classifying clothing photo.

## INSTRUCTION
1. Create your own machine learning model(s) for classifying clothing type.

2. Compare the accuracy of your new model with the example model.

3. Add your new model to the `cloth_classifier.py` program.  
   
4. Create a video to present your model and program (< 10min)
